Example Lua extension with a single function

This is the `pkg` branch which only contains the Zig package with Lua API wrapper in a module.
Other branches:
- `use-pkg`: Lua extension which uses this package as a dependency
- `simple`: self-contained version with no package management

Usage: switch to the `use-pkg` branch and see readme
